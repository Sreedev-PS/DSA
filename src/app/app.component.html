    <h1>Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three</h1>
    
    You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.
    
    Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    
    Output: 3
    
    Explanation:
    
    All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:
    
    Subtract 1 from 1.
    Add 1 to 2.
    Subtract 1 from 4.

    Example 2:
    
    Input: nums = [3,6,9]
    
    Output: 0
    
     
    
    Constraints:
    
    1 <= nums.length <= 50
    1 <= nums[i] <= 50
